This python function essentially fulfills the same purpose as pandas' get_dummies function but 
I just wrote one myself to get warmed up with python again after spending a lot of time learning other languages. 

This code specifically transforms the 'gender', 'smoker', and 'region' features in the original data set into new features: 
  'is_female', 'is_male', 'is_smoker', 'is_northeast', 'is_northwest', 'is_southeast', and 'is_southwest'. 
  This code writes a new CSV file where the old features are replaced with these and the features that were already quantitative are unchanged. 
  The first line of the resulting file contains new labels, but the code is otherwise ready to work with, having no missing data points or features described by strings.
